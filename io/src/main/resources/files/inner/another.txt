A comparison of apples and oranges occurs when two items or groups of items
are compared that cannot be practically compared, typically because of inherent,
fundamental and/or qualitative differences between the items.

The idiom, comparing apples and oranges, refers to the apparent differences between
items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or incommensurable, such as apples and oranges.
The idiom may also be used to indicate that a false analogy has been made between two items, such as
where an apple is faulted for not being a good orange.
